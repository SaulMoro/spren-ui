The Tabs component is a powerful and flexible navigation tool for your
applications. It offers various interaction modes, accessibility features, and
the ability to display different contents based on the selected tab.

## Usage

Start by importing the necessary components from the package:

```tsx
import { TabContent, TabIndicator, TabList, TabTrigger, Tabs } from '@spren-ui/components/tabs';
```

Here is a basic example:

<Primary />

<Controls />

## Initial Tab

To set a default tab on initial render, use the `value` prop:

<Canvas of={TabsStories.InitialTab} />

## Tab Indicator

To provide a visual cue for the selected tab, use the `TabIndicator` component:

<Canvas of={TabsStories.Indicator} />

## Disabled Tab

To disable a tab, simply pass the `disabled` prop to the `TabTrigger` component:

<Canvas of={TabsStories.DisabledTab} />

## Controlled Tabs

To create a controlled Tabs component, manage the current selected tab using the
`value` prop and update it when the `onChange` event handler is called:

<Canvas of={TabsStories.Controlled} />

## Vertical Tabs

The default orientation of the tabs is `horizontal`. To change the orientation,
set the `orientation` prop to `vertical`.

<Canvas of={TabsStories.Vertical} />

## Manual Activation

By default, the tab can be selected when it receives focus from either the
keyboard or pointer interaction. This is called automatic tab activation.

In contrast, manual tab activation means the tab is selected with the <kbd>Enter</kbd> key or by clicking on the tab.

<Canvas of={TabsStories.Manual} />

## Conclusion

The Tabs component offers a comprehensive and flexible solution for adding
tabbed navigation to your applications. With a wide variety of customization
options and features, it can accommodate various use cases and designs.

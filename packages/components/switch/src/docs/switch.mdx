<Title />

The Switch is an interactive, binary component designed for your applications.
It offers a clear, visual interface for users to enable or disable specific
settings, features, or functionalities

## Usage

Start by importing the necessary components from the package:

```tsx
import { Switch, SwitchControl, SwitchInput, SwitchLabel, SwitchThumb } from '@spren-ui/components/switch';
```

Here is a basic example:

<Primary />

<Controls />

## Controlled Switch

For a controlled Switch component, the state of the toggle is managed using the
checked prop, and updates when the onChange event handler is called:

<Canvas of={SwitchStories.Controlled} />

## Render Prop Usage

The Switch component also allows for a render prop, granting direct access to
its internal state. This enables you to dynamically adjust and customize aspects
of the component based on its current state:

<Canvas of={SwitchStories.RenderProp} />

## Conclusion

The Switch component provides a straightforward, intuitive solution for
incorporating toggle functionality into your applications. With its flexibility
for both controlled and uncontrolled scenarios and provision for dynamic
customization through its render prop, it can accommodate various use cases
effectively.
